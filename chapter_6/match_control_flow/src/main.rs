// Rust has an extremely powerful control flow operator called match that allows
// you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based
// on which pattern matches. The power comes from the expressiveness of the patterns
// and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are handled.

fn main() {
    /* The match Control Flow Operator */
    // We can write a function that can take an unkown US coin and determine
    // which coin it is and return its value in cents.

                Coin::Nickel => 5,
                Coin::Dime => 10,

        // is the value coin. This seems similar to an if but does not need to
        // return a boolean value and can be any type.

        // Next there are match arms having two parts: a pattern and some code.
        // The first pattern is Coin::Penny and then => operator followed by the
        // code to run. Match compares the resulting value against the pattern of
        // each arm in order then running the code associated with the pattern.

        // The code associated with each arm is an expression and the resulting
        // value of the expression is the value that gets returned for the entire
        // match expression.

    // brackets.

    /* Matching with Option<T> */

    // case when using Otpion<T>; We can also handle Option<T> using match by
    // comparing the variants of Option<T>. Let's say we want to write a function
    // that takes an Option<i32> and, if there's a value inside, add 1 to that value.
    // If there isn't a value inside, return the None value instead.

        // have the value Some(5). This matches the Some(i) pattern and i binds to
        // the value contained in some, 5. The code in the arm executes and creates
        // a new Some value with our total 6 inside.

    // We didn't handle the None case and Rust knows we didn't cover every possible
    // case. Matches in Rust are exhaustive: we must exhaust every last possibiltiy
    // in order for the code to be valid, especially in the case of Option<T>.
